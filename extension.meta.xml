		</release>
		<release version="1.3" date="2011-11-30" min="2.2">
			* Rails-like routing. You may now use a syntax similar to `page-name/:user/projects/:project` for matching and reference each parameter by its name: `/new-page-name/:user/:project`
		</release>
		<release version="1.2" date="2011-09-28" min="2.2">
			* Updates to add inline help to the Routes/Redirects in the preferences page.
			* Core code change to wrap the routes and redirects in checks for stability, and to allow more control.

		<release version="1.1.1" date="2011-09-25" min="2.2" />
		<release version="1.1.0" date="2011-09-25" min="2.2">
			* Removed the global option to redirect routes.
			* Changed the duplicator templates to allow either Routes or Redirects, instead of the global choice.
			* Added updating logic.
			* Added prevention of routing if the code is updated, but the extension reference in Symphony isn't. This is due to the functionality changing, and will prevent errors.
